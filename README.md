# Inline CSS Extractor
###### By Dennis Sauve

### What is the Inline CSS Extractor?

The Inline CSS Extractor takes local html files, scans for inline stylings, creates style classes based on those findings, then replaces the inline stylings with class declaration in html.

### Where would this be used?

If you're working on legacy support for websites and want to maintain a sites appearance while updating the code to adhere to modern conventions.

### Why did you make this?

I made the initial version of this to avoid having to comb through ~15,000 lines of code and removing the stylings one by one.

### Usage

Simply download, and run.
